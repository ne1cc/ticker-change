        "long": "The standard deviation of daily returns scaled to a one-year horizon. It measures dispersion, not direction — a high number just means large moves in either direction. Roughly, a 30% annualised vol implies a typical daily move near 1.9%.",

        "long": "The asymmetry of the daily-return distribution. Negative skew (common in equities) means crashes tend to be sharper than rallies — the left tail is fatter. Positive skew means occasional large gains. Zero skew is a symmetric distribution.",

        "long": "Excess kurtosis measures tail-heaviness relative to a normal distribution (which is 0). High positive values mean fat tails: extreme days happen far more often than a bell curve predicts. Most financial returns are strongly leptokurtic (fat-tailed), which is why VaR built on a normal assumption understates risk.",

A strategy with violent rallies and shallow dips scores far better on Sortino than on Sharpe, which is why trend-following results are usually quoted with both. Sortino well above Sharpe means the volatility is mostly upside; the two converging means losses and gains are equally choppy.",

Unlike Sharpe it ignores day-to-day chop entirely and keys on the single worst peak-to-trough episode, so it is sensitive to one bad run and to how long the sample is. Above 1 means the annual return exceeded the worst drawdown; below 0.5 means the drawdown dominated.",

It answers a different question from Sharpe: not 'was the return worth the risk' but 'was the edge over the benchmark reliable'. A high IR with a small alpha means a small but steady edge; a large alpha with a low IR means the outperformance came from a handful of lucky windows.",

        "long": "The intercept of the strategy's excess returns regressed on the benchmark's, annualised. It strips out whatever the strategy earned simply by carrying market beta, so a high-beta strategy in a bull market can post a large total return and still show near-zero alpha. It is only as meaningful as the beta estimate behind it, and on a short backtest the standard error is wide — treat a small alpha as indistinguishable from zero.",

It is a cross-sectional comparison aid, not an expected return: two names with the same 12-1 return sit at very different risk-adjusted scores if one got there calmly and the other on a 90%-vol ride.

        "long": "A trend-strength measure rather than a return. Because both legs are moving averages it reacts slowly and turns over far less than a 12-1 return, which cuts whipsaws in choppy markets at the cost of late entries and exits.
